SWGANH Database Installer / Backup Utility README
-------------------------------------------------

Two sample config files are included, please make sure that you edit the required file
for your operating system, and once edited rename it swganh.conf.

The swganh.conf file has to reside in the same directory as the swganh_install.py script.

You will also need to create the following folders under the path where the script is

	/schema  --> (contains all the SQL files)
	/archive --> (used to save the backup database, as well as the log file)

The script has been tested on both linux and windows.
