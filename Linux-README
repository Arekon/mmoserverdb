When importing on Linux the .bat doesn't work.

Mass import using the following console command you must manually cd into each of the directory in the import order as set below.

for i in $(ls *.sql); do mysql -uUSERNAME -pPASSWORD < $i; done 

Replace the caps USERNAME and PASSWORD with your user with root access to the DB.
